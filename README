        Xilinx ZYNQ Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document describes common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the xilinx-zynq layer
------------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
	# git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

It is necessary to load the DTB(device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel uImage. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

	# make kds
	# make zynq-<Board Name>.dtb

Note: <Board Name> can be one of the ZYNQ boards' name, such as zc706 or zc702.

The DTB can then be found in the
  build/linux-windriver/linux-<board>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm/boot/dts/
directory.

Copy DTB image to MMC/SD or QSPI Flash, and use u-boot's fatload command
to transfer it to the board before booting along with kernel image.


3.1 Boot from MMC/SD card
-------------------------

MMC/SD can be set as the default booting device for this board and two
partitions have been created on the MMC/SD card by default, the first one
is booting partition while the second is root filesystem, which can be
created by the fdisk command on the host machine.

Note: please refer to the README.hardware for further details about the
switches configuration for setting MMC/SD as the first boot device.

3.1.1 Create two partitions and store the u-boot image
------------------------------------------------------
(1) Create two partitions on the MMC/SD card.

	# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

Suppose the device node for MMC/SD card on the host machine is the
/dev/mmcblk0.

(2) Create VFAT filesystem on the first partition.

	# mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1

(3) Copy BOOT.BIN file to /dev/mmcblk0p1.

The BOOT.BIN file can be downloaded from the XILINX's website at
http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+14.7-2013.3+Release

	# mkdir /mnt/sd
	# mount -t vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cp BOOT.BIN /mnt/sd
	# umount /mnt/sd


3.1.2 Copy kernel image and DTB image to /dev/mmcblk0p1
-------------------------------------------------------

	# mkdir /mnt/sd
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cd <buildprj>/export/images/
	# cp uImage-xilinx-zynq.bin  /mnt/sd/uImage
	# cp uImage-zynq-<Board Name>.dtb /mnt/sd/devicetree.dtb
	# umount /mnt/sd


3.1.3 Decompress MMC/SD root filesystem
---------------------------------------

Assuming the second partition is used for the root filesystem, format it
with one of the most popular filesystem types supported by Linux, for
instance, ext3 and mount it and deploy the root filesystem image there:

	# mkfs.ext3 /dev/mmcblk0p2
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/sd
	# cd <buildprj>/export/images/
	# tar -C /mnt/sd -jxf wrlinux-image-glibc-std-xilinx-zynq.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner
	# umount /mnt/sd


3.1.4 Boot from MMC/SD card
---------------------------

To boot from MMC/SD card, please use u-boot's commands as follows:

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 devicetree.dtb
	# fatload mmc 0 0x10600000 uImage
	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootwait
	# bootm 0x10600000 - 0x1000000


3.2 Boot kernel from QSPI Flash
-------------------------------

3.2.1 QSPI Flash layout
-----------------------

The storage capacity of the QSPI flash on ZYNQ board is 16MB, by default following
partitions have been created on it:

	Start			End		Definition
	0x0			0x100000	qspi-fsbl-uboot
	0x100000		0x600000	qspi-linux
	0x600000		0x620000	qspi-device-tree
	0x620000		0xc00000	qspi-rootfs
	0xc00000		0x1000000	qspi-bitstream

Be extra careful not to touch bootloader partition about FSBL and u-boot. If
needed, you can alter the layout of the rest of QSPI Flash. In addition, you
also need to modify the QSPI Flash device node in the below DTB source file to
reflect such changes accordingly:

	linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/zynq-<Board Name>.dts

Then re-generate the DTB image as described previously.


3.2.2 Save bootloader image to the bootloader partitions
--------------------------------------------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x100000 BOOT.BIN
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0 0x100000
	# sf write 0x100000 0 ${filesize}

Before writing the flash you need to know its current layout. Fortunately, you
can get this information by running the 'cat /proc/mtd' command once booting up
from MMC/SD device or NFS server. When loading the BOOT.BIN image from MMC/SD
card, its file size will be automatically recorded in u-boot's "filesize"
variable, which can be leveraged later.


3.2.3 Update DTB to support to boot from QSPI flash
---------------------------------------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x100000 devicetree.dtb
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0x600000 0x20000
	# sf write 0x100000 0x600000 ${filesize}


3.2.4 Copy kernel image
-----------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x100000 uImage
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0x100000 0x500000
	# sf write 0x100000 0x100000 ${filesize}


3.2.5 Target Note
-----------------

Since the size of the qspi-rootfs partition is no more than 8MB, unable to
accommodate a reasonable jffs2 filesystem which can be as large as 60MB,
therefore we cannot deploy jffs2 filesystem on QSPI flash, and the DTB defaults
to mount the root filesystem from MMC/SD card.


3.3 NFS Root File System
------------------------

3.3.1 Prepare NFS and TFTP servers
----------------------------------

The files in above example can be found in <buildprj>/export/images and
are copied to the directory of the NFS/TFTP server.


3.3.2 Boot from NFS root filesystem
-----------------------------------

To boot from NFS rootfs, please use u-boot's commands as follows:

	# setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.10
	# setenv serverip 192.168.1.1
	# setenv rootpath /nfsexport
	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath ip=dhcp
	# tftp 0x10600000 uImage-xilinx-zynq.bin
	# tftp 0x1000000 uImage-zynq-<Board Name>.dtb
	# bootm 0x10600000 - 0x1000000


4. Features
===========

4.1 USB feature
---------------

4.1.1 Introduction
------------------

The Xilinx ZYNQ board supports USB OTG, USB host and USB device modes.
They share one common interface, therefore any mode can only be activated
exclusively. Jumpers can be used to switch among different modes, please
refer to README.hardware for the detailed information.


4.1.2 Usage and verification
----------------------------

USB host mode is supported by DTB by default, no extra changes to DTB is
needed. However, in order to enable other USB modes, DTB needs to be shifted
accordingly. One convenient approach is to alter it on-line. Alternatively,
you can directly modify its source code and re-generate a new DTB image.

Refer to the 4.1.3 section of the README.hardware file for jumper settings
for various USB modes.

1. Enable OTG host mode

Modify dtb for OTG mode in booting step

	# tftp 0x1000000 devicetree.dtb
	# fdt addr 0x1000000
	# fdt set /amba/ps7-usb dr_mode otg

Plug in a B cable and connect to the host machine to verify the OTG device mode.

Then replace the B cable with the A cable and enable OTG VBUS in linux as follows:

	# cd /sys/devices/amba.0/e0002000.ps7-usb/xusbps-otg.0/inputs
	# echo 1 > a_bus_req

2. Enable USB Device mode

Change the board's DTB source file and modify following line from:

	dr_mode = "host";

to:

	dr_mode = "peripheral";

Then re-generate the DTB image as described previously. Use the new DTB image
to boot the board and plug in a B cable and connect to the host machine
to verify the device mode.
