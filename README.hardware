4.1.2 Specify boot medium
-------------------------

The ROM bootloader loads the secondary bootloader from the start or the first
partition of the selected device and executes it, which is indeed a BOOT.BIN
image that encapsulates the FSBL and u-boot properly.

Please refer to the 3.1.1 and 3.2.2 section of the README file for the details
about preparing the secondary bootloader on the MMC/SD card and QSPI Flash
respectively.


4.1.2.1 HW-Z7-ZC706 REV 1.2
---------------------------

1. Booting from SD card

The SW11 on the front panel is used for the configuration of booting sequence,
the default setting (00110) specifies to boot from the SD card:

	SW11.1 = OFF
	SW11.2 = OFF
	SW11.3 = ON
	SW11.4 = ON
	SW11.5 = OFF

2. Booting from QSPI flash

Shift SW11 setting to 00010 in order to boot from QSPI Flash:

	SW11.1 = OFF
	SW11.2 = OFF
	SW11.3 = OFF
	SW11.4 = ON
	SW11.5 = OFF
